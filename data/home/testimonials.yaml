    text: "What can I say about ATEL but they are the best! I own a small TV production company out of Wisconsin and have a fleet vehicle in the DC area. After working with the local dealership I found that I was not getting the customer service I should be getting. That's where ATEL and Brian came into play. He has done what a business owner would do for a customer. (TRUE CUSTOMER SERVICE)"

They are even selected by the state of Maryland to repair all of their equipment that they cannot do in house."

    - text: "Brian knows RVs inside and out! Could not have found a more knowledgeable and committed person to troubleshoot and problem solve our RV (engine systems) problems that presented themselves on our road trip. How lucky we were to break down just two miles from ATEL!"
